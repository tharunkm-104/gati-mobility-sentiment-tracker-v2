    width space/joiner, BOM, soft hyphen...) that survive an ordinary
    strip() and silently break an exact match, so a genuinely-positive
    item quietly falls through to the neutral bucket with no error
    anywhere. This strips those out first, then matches on a 3-letter
    prefix so 'Positive', 'positive ', 'pos' etc. all resolve the same

    into the CSV cell it's writing. In the simple case that's just
    `<https://example.com>`, harmless to unwrap. But it can go further and
    swallow a second copy of the URL plus the start of the next field into
    a garbled `<url|junk>` span, which then shifts every column after it
